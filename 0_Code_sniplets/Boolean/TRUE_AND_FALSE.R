# Check what is TRUE or FALSE

# example numbers

x <- 3
y <- 1:10

a <- 1
b <- 1:10


# ask if one value is larger than another one

x > y
a > b

# ask what is the opposite of: ask if one value is larger than another one
# this is not the same like: # ask if one value is smaller than another one

!x > y
!a > b

# ask if one value is smaller than another one

x < y
a < b
