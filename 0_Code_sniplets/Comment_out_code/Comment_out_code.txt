comment out code

- single line
use the "#" sign to comment code (means it will not be executed)



- several lines
mark all the lines you want to comment out

on Mac
use Cmd + Shift + C to comment out the marked lines all at once 


# line one
# line two
# line three


on Windows
use Ctrl + Shift + C to comment out the marked lines all at once

# line one
# line two
# line three


- special cases
if there is a blank line between commented lines and you mark all the lines, 
you will get more "#" and the existing ones do not dissapear when you use the key-shortcut
this is because of the blank line. Either you fill that line with a "#", 
or you stop before the blank line when you mark your lines

# a

# line one
# line two
# line three
